# `ned` Usage

The program's help gives a comprehensive description of its available
options, the [wiki](https://github.com/nevdelap/ned/wiki) gives
further details, and the [TL;DR](#tldr) section below has a list of
quick and easy example usages.

```text

Usage: ned [OPTION]... [-p] <PATTERN> [FILE]...

For regular expression power users, ned is like grep, but with
powerful replace capabilities, and more powerful than sed, as it
isn't restricted to line oriented editing.

FILEs are ASCII or UTF-8 text files. For regex syntax see:

  https://docs.rs/regex/1.1.0/regex/#syntax

Options:
    -p, --pattern PATTERN
                        specify pattern. if the option isn't used the pattern
                        must precede the files. the option allows the pattern
                        to be put after the files for more convenient editing
    -r, --replace REPLACEMENT
                        replace matches, may include named groups. replaces
                        always operate on whole files
    -w, --whole-files   operate on whole files. otherwise matches are line
                        oriented
    -n, --number N      match/replace N occurrences
    -k, --skip N        skip N occurrences before matching/replacing
    -b, --backwards     -n --number and -k --skip options count backwards
    -i, --ignore-case   ignore case
    -s, --single        . matches newlines, ^ and $ match beginning and end of
                        each file. use with --whole-files
    -m, --multiline     multiline, ^ and $ match beginning and end of each
                        line. use with --whole-files
    -x, --extended      ignore whitespace and # comments
        --case-replacements
                        enable \U - uppercase, \L - lowercase, \I - initial
                        uppercase (title case), \F - first uppercase (sentence
                        case) replacements. \E marks the end of a case
                        replacement
    -o, --matches-only  show only matches
    -g, --group GROUP   show the match group, specified by number or name
    -v, --no-match      show only non-matching
    -f, --filenames-only
                        show only filenames containing matches. use with -v
                        --no-match to show filenames without matches
    -F, --no-filenames  don't show filesnames
    -l, --line-numbers-only
                        show only line numbers containing matches. use with -v
                        --no-match to show line numbers without matches. use
                        without -w --whole-files
    -L, --no-line-numbers
                        don't show line numbers, use without -w --whole-files
    -C, --context LINES show LINES lines around each matching line. is the
                        same as specifying both -B --before and -A --after
                        with the same LINES. use without -w --whole-files
    -B, --before LINES  show LINES lines before each matching line. use
                        without -w --whole-files
    -A, --after LINES   show LINES lines after each matching line. use without
                        -w --whole-files
    -R, --recursive     recurse
    -l, --follow        follow symlinks (Ignored on Windows.)
        --include GLOB  match only files that match GLOB
        --exclude GLOB  skip files matching GLOB
        --exclude-dir GLOB
                        skip directories matching GLOB
    -u, --ignore-non-utf8
                        quietly ignore files that cannot be parsed as UTF-8
                        (or ASCII). because this requires reading the file the
                        --exclude option should be preferred
    -a, --all           do not ignore entries starting with .
    -c, --colors [WHEN] show filenames and matches in color when a real
                        stdout. defaults to auto, can be set to always to show
                        color even when not a real stdout, or never
        --stdout        output to stdout
    -q, --quiet         suppress all normal output
    -V, --version       output version information and exit
    -h, --help          print this help and exit

Environment:
    NED_DEFAULTS        ned options added to the program's arguments. is
                        a space delimited list of options and is not first
                        interpreted by a shell, so quotes are not required.
                        for example...

                        NED_DEFAULTS="-u -R --exclude *.bk --exclude-dir .git"
Exit codes:
    0                   matches found/replaced
    1                   no matches

Quiet:
    When -q --quiet is specified ned tests for matches and returns an exit
    code of 0 if a match is found in ANY file. Quiet matches will only read
    as many files as needed to find a match. Even without this shortcutting
    behaviour quiet matches are more performant than non-quiet matches.

## I.A.Q. (Infrequently Asked Questions)

***Why isn't \U working? (or \L, \I, \F)***

Because case replacing is off by default to not waste cycles when you're not doing it,
since that is most of the time, generally. See the help... (as of v1.2.0)

```
       --case-replacements
                        enable \U - uppercase, \L - lowercase, \I - initial
                        uppercase (title case), \F - first uppercase (sentence
                        case) replacements. \E marks the end of a case
                        replacement
```

***Why do I get errors like ned: /path/file invalid utf-8 sequence of 1 bytes from index 25?***

Because by default ned reads everything unless you tell it not to read it. If you want it to always
ignore non-ASCII, non-UTF-8 files you can put this in NED_DEFAULTS. See the help...

```
   -u, --ignore-non-utf8
                        quietly ignore files that cannot be parsed as UTF-8
                        (or ASCII). because this requires reading the file the
                        --exclude option should be preferred
```

***Why don't the tests pass in Git Bash?***

Git Bash does not support colored output using ansi_term. Run the tests in cmd.exe.

## TL;DR

**NOTE:** This section is new, so far I've just typed these in off the top of my head, some are not there yet, and I have not tested any of them, so there will be typos.

These examples use short options and search for 'dog' and replace with 'cat' wherever the example doesn't need a regular expression to demonstrate what it is doing.

#### Search non-hidden files in the current directory.
```
ned dog .
```
#### Search txt files in the current directory.
```
ned dog *.txt
```
#### Search including hidden files.
```
ned -a dog .
```
#### Search recursively.
```
ned -R dog .
```
#### Search case insensitively.
```
ned -i dog .
```
#### Search always showing colored output.
```
ned -c dog .
ned --colors=always dog .
```
#### Search never showing colored output.
```
ned --colors=never dog .
```
#### Search showing colored output when outputting to a terminal.
```
ned --colors=auto dog .
```
#### Set default arguments in your terminal environment.
```
export NED_DEFAULTS='-i --colors=always'
```
#### Search showing colored output and having it work when paging with less.
```
ned --colors=always dog . | less -R
```
#### Search showing no output, to just use the exit code in a script if something is found or not found.
Is also more efficient.
```
ned -q dog .
```
#### Search specifying the pattern at the end of the command, for convenience of editing.
```
ned . -p dog
```
#### Search not showing line numbers.
```
ned -L dog .
```
#### Search only showing numbers of matched lines.
```
ned -l dog .
```
#### Search not showing file names
```
ned -F dog .
```
#### Search only showing file names of matched files.
```
ned -f dog .
```
#### Search showing only matches.
```
ned -o dog .
```
#### Search really showing only matches.
```
ned -oFL dog .
```
#### Search matching 3 occurences.
```
ned -n 3 dog .
```
#### Search skipping 3 occurrences and finding 2 occurences. (Most useful for replaces.)
```
ned -s 3 -n 2 dog .
```
#### Search backwards from the end of the file. (Most useful for replaces.)
You can also skip backwards, and match n occurrences backwards.
```
ned -b dog .
```
#### Search recursively only including certain files.
```
ned -R --include '*.txt' dog .
```
#### Search ignoring files.
```
ned -R--exclude '*.htm' dog .
```
#### Search ignoring all non-utf8 files.
Quietly ignore files that cannot be parsed as UTF-8 (or ASCII). Because this requires reading the file the --exclude option should be preferred. E.g. --exclude '*.png'
```
ned -u dog .
```
#### Search ignoring directories.
```
ned -R --exclude-dir '.git' dog .
```
#### Search showing context of 5 lines around each match.
```
ned -C 5 dog .
```
#### Search showing context of 5 lines before each match.
```
ned -B 5 dog .
```
#### Search showing context of 5 lines after match.
```
ned -A 5 dog .
```
#### Search matching the beginning or end of lines.
```
```
#### Search matching the beginning or end of files.
```
```
#### Replace.
```
ned dog -r cat .
```
#### Replace using numbered group references.
```
ned 'the ([a-z]+) dog and the ([a-z]+) cat' -r 'the $2 dog and the $1 cat'
```
#### Replace using named group references.
```
```
#### Replace matching beginnings and endings of lines.
```
```
#### Replace spanning lines.
```
```
#### Replace spanning lines and still matching beginnings and endings of lines.
As opposed to matching the beginnings and endings of the file.
```
```
#### Replace changing case
'big dog' and 'smelly dog' replaced with 'BIG! dog' and 'SMELLY! dog'.

Available case replacements: \U - uppercase, \L - lowercase, \I - initial uppercase (title case), \F - first uppercase (sentence case).
```
ned ' ([a-z]+) dog' --case-replacements -r '\U$1\E! dog' --stdout .
```
#### Replace and see the results without updating the target files.
```
ned dog -r cat --stdout .
```
#### Unident tables and lists in MadCap Flare XHTML topic and snippet files.
```
ned -R --include '*.htm' --include '*.flsnp' --exclude-dir .git '    (</?(table|col|tbody|tr|th|td|ol|ul|li)[^>]*>)' -r '$1'
```
