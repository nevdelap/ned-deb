This is a file that has the case change escape sequences in it, and they
shouldn't be interpreted as case change escape sequences when doing replaces
on this file. A likely reason for them to exist in the file is in Windows
paths, so here's a contrived example.

C:\A file path\WITH\Upper\Lower\First\and\Initial\escape sequences in it.txt
